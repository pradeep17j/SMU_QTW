the week for me is of a small child s burn and blacken arm it tini finger curl into a fist protrud from the remain of a human bonfir in ahmadabad gujarat in india the murder of children is someth of an indian specialti the routin daili kill of unwant girl babi the massacr of innoc in nelli assam in the 1980 when villag turn against neighbor villag the massacr of sikh children in delhi dure the horrifi repris murder that follow indira gandhi s assassin they bear wit to our particular gift alway most dazzlingli in evid at time of religi unrest for dous our children in kerosen and set them alight or cut their throat or smother them or just club them to death with a good strong length of wood i say our becaus i write as an indian man born and bred who love india deepli and know that what one of us doe today ani of us is potenti capabl of do tomorrow if i take pride in india s strength then india s sin must be mine as well do i sound angri good asham and disgust i certainli hope so becaus as india undergo it worst bout of hindu muslim bloodlet in more than a decad mani peopl have not been sound anyth like angri asham or disgust enough polic chief have been excus their men s unwilling to defend the citizen of india without regard to religion by say that these men have feel too and are subject to the same sentiment as the nation in gener meanwhil india s polit master have been tut tut and offer the usual sooth lie about the situat be brought under control it ha escap nobodi s notic that the rule parti the bharatiya janata parti bjp or indian peopl s parti and the hindu extremist of the vishwa hindu parishad vhp or world hindu council are sister organ and offshoot of the same parent bodi even some intern comment such as britain s independ newspap urg us to bewar excess pessim the horribl truth about commun slaughter in india is that we re use to it it happen everi so often then it die down that s how life is folk most of the time india is the world s largest secular democraci and if onc in a while it let off a littl crazi religi steam we mustn t let that distort the pictur of cours there are polit explan ever sinc decemb 1992 when a vhp mob demolish a 400 year old muslim mosqu in ayodhya which they claim wa built on the sacr birthplac of the god ram hindu fanat have been look for thi fight the piti of it is that some muslim were readi to give it to them their murder attack on the train load of vhp activist at godhra with it aw atavist echo of the kill of hindu and muslim by the train load dure the partit riot of 1947 play right into the hindu extremist hand the vhp ha evid tire of what it see as the equivoc and insuffici radic of india s bjp govern prime minist atal bihari vajpaye is more moder than hi parti he also head a coalit govern and ha been oblig to abandon much of the bjp s more extrem hindu nationalist rhetor to hold the coalit togeth but it isn t work anymor in state elect across the countri the bjp is be trounc thi may have been the last straw for the vhp firebrand whi put up with the govern s betray of their fascist agenda when that betray doesn t even result in elector success the elector failur of the bjp is thu in all probabl the spark that lit the fire the vhp is determin to build a hindu templ on the site of the demolish ayodhya mosqu that s where the godhra dead were come from and there are reprehens idiot tragic muslim in india equal determin to resist them vajpaye ha insist that the slow indian court must decid the right and wrong of the ayodhya issu the vhp is no longer prepar to wait the distinguish indian writer mahasveta devi in a letter to india s presid k r narayanan blame the gujarat govern led by a bjp hard liner as well as the central govern for do too littl too late she pin the blame firmli on the motiv well plan out and provoc action of the hindu nationalist but anoth writer the nobel laureat v s naipaul speak in india just a week befor the violenc erupt denounc india s muslim en mass and prais the nationalist movement the murder of godhra must inde be denounc and mahasveta devi in her letter demand stern legal action against them but the vhp is determin to destroy that secular democraci in which india take such public pride and which it doe so littl to protect and by support them naipaul make himself a fellow travel of fascism and disgrac the nobel award the polit discours matter and explain a good deal but there s someth beneath it someth we don t want to look in the face name that in india as elsewher in our darken world religion is the poison in the blood where religion interven mere innoc is no excus yet we go on skate around thi issu speak of religion in the fashion languag of respect what is there to respect in ani of thi or in ani of the crime now be commit almost daili around the world in religion s dread name how well with what fatal result religion erect totem and how will we are to kill for them and when we ve done it often enough the deaden of affect that result make it easier to do it again so india s problem turn out to be the world s problem what happen in india ha happen in god s name the problem s name is god salman
