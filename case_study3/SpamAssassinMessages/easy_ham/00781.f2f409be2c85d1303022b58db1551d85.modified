climat vital 02 htm a graph deriv from vostok ice core sampl of co2 and temperatur fluctuat over the past 400k year recent high resolut studi of histor co2 concentr and temperatur over hundr of thousand of year have shown a modest correl between the two in a number of case co2 level increas are not in phase with temperatur increas and actual trail the increas in temperatur by a short time i e increas in temperatur preced increas in co2 concentr the more studi that are done of the geolog record the more it seem that co2 concentr are correl with temperatur increas but are not significantli caus base on the vostok data you are right there is a veri strong correl between temperatur and co2 concentr but it doesn t alway appear to be causal with respect to absolut co2 concentr it is also import to point out that our best data to date suggest that they follow a fairli regular cycl with a period of about 100 000 year also correct the peak of each cycl is at about 290 300 ppm co2 as it happen current co2 concentr are within 10 of other previou cyclic concentr peak for which we have good data not correct mauna loa data http www grida no climat vital 06 htm and http cdiac ornl gov ftp ndp001 maunaloa co2 show that the current co2 concentr are at 370ppm 18 greater than the highest record valu from the past 400k year furthermor co2 concentr are grow at 15ppm everi 10 year much faster than ani record increas in the vostok data though perhap the vostok data isn t capabl of such fine resolut in other word we may be ad to the co2 level no we are definit ad to co2 level look at the follow chart http www grida no climat vital 07 htm show co2 concentr sinc 1870 the histor record not onli is the co2 increas over 130 year unpreced in the vostok record it is clear that the rate of chang is increas not decreas there is no other compel explan for thi increas except for anthropogen input you re realli out on the fring if you re debat thi even global warm skeptic gener conced thi point but it look a lot like we would be build a molehil on top of a mountain in the histor record at the veri least there is noth anomal about current co2 concentr wrong again current co2 level are current unpreced over the past 400k year unless there is some mechan that allow co2 level to quickli spike and then return back to normal background level and henc the spike might not show up in the ice core still by around 2075 2100 we will have reach 500 ppm co2 a level that even you would have a hard time argu away also co2 level interact with the biospher in a manner that ultim affect temperatur again the interact is not entir predict but thi is believ to be one of the regul neg feedback system mention abov ye cloud and ocean are a big unknown still we know ocean water ha a finit capac to store co2 and if the world temperatur doesn t increas but we all have seattl like weather all the time the effect would be enorm last as greenhous gase go co2 isn t particularli potent although it make up for it in volum in some case gase such as water and methan have a far greater impact as greenhous gase on a per molecul basi water vapor may actual be the key greenhous ga someth that co2 onli indirectli effect through it interact with the biospher correct data on rel contribut of greenhous gass http www grida no climat vital 05 htm note that methan concentr now are much higher than pre industri level mani cow fart and rice paddi outgass and methan is also a contributor in the format of atmospher water vapor anoth clearli anthropogen increas in a greenhous ga i m in favor of reduct in methan level as well data on water vapor here http www agu org sci soc mockler html co2 wa an easi mark for earli environment but all the recent studi and data i ve seen give me the impress that it is larg a passeng on the climat ride rather than the driver i tend to think that holist and techic approach would work best in reduc global warm i favor an energi polici that ha a mix of solar wind and nuclear with all carbon base combust use renew sourc of c h bond aggress pursuit of carbon sink strategi also make sens buri tree deep underground for exampl approach that involv reduct in lifestyl to a sustain level are unrealist american just won t do it you d be surpris at the number of climat chang research drive suv but as california show dure last year s energi crisi shift in pattern of consumpt are possibl and improv effici is an easi sell jim"}
