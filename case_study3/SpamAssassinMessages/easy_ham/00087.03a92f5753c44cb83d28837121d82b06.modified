that look like a case of my experi is comprehens your s is anecdot they don t know what they re talk about 1 the peopl who pay the wage don t give a flyin heck what program languag you write thing in they just want it to work in my experi they do care it ha to work certainli and in particular it ha to work with what they ve alreadi got and it ha to work on client s system my limit experi of java start a few year ago when support on linux wa so terribl that i ran away scream and haven t come back yet microsoft ha announc that they plan to remov java from window they took it out of xp alreadi and it ha to be instal with a servic pack somehow i can t imagin them remov the abil to run c program 2 c and c forc the develop to solv problem such as memori manag over and over again can t say i spend ani notic amount of time on memori manag issu apart from the fact that i frequent need 4 gb it s about design pattern architectur high level stuff if your problem just requir applic of a design pattern to solv then it s trivial anyway irrespect of languag i am amaz by the amount of time wast by peopl talk about low level problem that have been solv 10 million time over and over and over again you appear to be gratuit assert that c programm wast time on irrelev low level problem and java programm don t depend entir on the programm not the languag 3 java is not just a program languag it s also a platform buzzword a monolith set of api s or a crap load of differ api s slice and dice the same problem 50 differ way unsupport assert 4 if you have a program of ani type of high complex written in c you can t possibl think that you could port it to differ platform within the same magnitud of cost as java dunno e g i port a wee 15000 line c program to darwin on powerpc in a few minut yesterday sure if it wa badli design it would be 10 time the size and harder to port if it depend on unavail librari it would be much harder portabl code is easi to port at least that is the case when then languag you use is avail on the target platform i also run on arm system with no proper java 5 make no sens for a scientif or a busi project to depend on a person java imho reduc the depend of these entiti on the individu develop as it is much easier to revers engin java as it is to revers engin c larg applic you can pay a good programm to solv your problem now or els get some kid to hack spaghetti fortran in ani languag and then pay for mainten headach ad infinitum 6 hardwar is get so fast that i m not sure if the perform differ between java and c c are relev ani more whoah perform matter to me everi day right now i m take time out to write email while wait for a job to run sure i could wait 5 year until everyon s pc is fast enough to gener random ec s in no time when ani twit will be abl to program ineffici code that is fast enough and the market will be overrun by competitor or i can do it now when veri few peopl can the end goal is the scientif or busi problem to be solv ye and for those problem languag such as java smalltalk and other allow you to think more high level than low level think of bit and byte take too much gray matter away from the real import problem it s true i admit everyth mea maxima culpa work in c make me spend all day think base rank thought about hard core bitographi not actual i spend most of my time think in high level mathemat whi do most comput scientist insist on solv the same problem over and over again dunno and frankli i don t see the relev to the issu at hand i m sure java is fine for some stuff as is c or whatev hors for cours
