com pipermail fork date wed 4 sep 2002 11 03 03 0700 so like mani young children my daughter tatum age 21 month realli like music she also like to have control over her environ and thi mean she want to be the one put cd into the cd player and get the music play by watch tatum i ve discov that you can learn a lot about ui design from watch 21 month old use technolog there is definit a market nich for a toddler friendli cd mp3 player the cd player we have combin play and paus in a singl button but doesn t provid instantan feedback that the button wa push instead requir you to wait until the music start 5 10 second thi is a ui disast sinc tatum doesn t get feedback right away she press the button again therebi paus the cd befor it even play she ll onli ever get music if she press the button an odd number of time thi happen a surpris amount of the time sinc she eventu hit the button again when the music doesn t play for toddler press play must caus the music to start immedi within half a second for the toddler to get the causal and not press the button multipl time as well press the button multipl time shouldn t chang the semant like an elev button no matter how mani time you press the elev still come to that floor the play button need to be the same the back hing door mechan feed the cd into the player is also a ui disast for tatum sinc the door hing on the back tatum ha to angl cd to put them in and take them out put cd in isn t much of a problem but take them out is sinc tatum grab cd by the back edg that edg come out first hit the lid tatum eventu forc and wiggl the cd out a process that s hard on the cd and the player but which hasn t yet result in the cd player be broken surprisingli it hasn t been a problem get the cd hole onto the spindl tatum seem to understand thi concept and the cd load area geometri natur guid the cd tatum s cd player also play tape and ha fm radio for a toddler thi is a mistak tatum doesn t understand the need to flick a switch to put the player into a specif mode she understand put a cd in and press the play button she sometim understand the button for advanc a song but use them errat as well the radio featur ha both fm mono and fm stero a distinct total lost on tatum tatum onli understand the binari distinct of music no music what would the ideal toddler cd player be like it would immedi start play a cd after it wa load as soon as the cd load door wa close it would give some audibl feedback it would have a singl larg play button the other typic cd control would be larger than normal but at least half the size of the play button and locat far away from the play button so there is no chanc of them get accident press on the way to play the play button would be a bright color that is differ from the color of the player and differ from the color of the other cd control key the devic would onli play cd no other function the cd load area would flip open at least 80 degre it should be small approach for a toddler it should be possibl to repeatedli drop the player from a height of 1 2 without affect the player jim"}
