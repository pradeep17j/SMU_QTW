s easi enough for you to chang the habea score yourself on your instal if habea fail to live up to it promis to onli licens the warrant mark to non spammer and to place all violat on the hil then i have no doubt that justin and craig will quickli remov us from the next releas but you re tri to kill habea befor it ha a chanc to show ani promis i think i ve work on sa enough to understand that i can local a score i m just not comfort with use spamassassin as a vehicl for drum up your busi at the expens of our user base i have to agre here if habea is go to die just becaus sa doe not support it that s a seriou problem with the busi model but that is nobodi s problem but habea s a possibl solut is for habea s busi model to includ some kind of incent for user of sa to give it the benefit of the doubt i have yet to think of an incent that fit the bill on thu 29 aug 2002 justin mason wrote i don t see a problem support it in spamassassin but i see dan s point high score as far as i can see that s becaus spamassassin is assign such high score to legit newslett these day and the habea mark ha to bring it down below that imo we have to fix the high scorer anyway no spam ever need to score over 5 in our score system 5 tag anyway thi is off the topic of the rest of thi discuss but amavisd in all it incarn and mimedefang and sever other mta plugin all reject at smtp time messag that score higher than some threshold often 10 if some new releas were to start score all spam no higher than 5 1 there d better be zero fp becaus all those filter would drop their threshold to 5 on thu 29 aug 2002 michael moncur wrote but i agre that there need to be more focu on elimin rule that frequent hit on newslett if ani newslett actual use the habea mark that will be one way to help newslett won t use the mark habea is price way too high a factor of at least 20 over what the market will bear imo on a per messag basi for most typic mail list lockergnom say to afford it on thu 29 aug 2002 harold hallikainen wrote habeu ha come up with a veri clever way to use exist law to battl spam it seem that at some point they could drop the licens fee to 1 or less and make all their incom off su the spammer for copyright infring sorri that just can t work if the habea mark actual becom both widespread enough in non spam and effect enforc enough to be absent from spam such that e g sa could assign a posit score to messag that do not have it then spammer are out of busi and habea ha no one to sue there s nobodi left to charg except the peopl who want or are forc against their will becaus their mail won t get through otherwis to use the mark convers if there are enough spammer forg the mark for habea to make all it incom su them then the mark is useless for the purpos for which it wa design either way it seem to me that after mayb a coupl of lawsuit against real spammer and a lot of ceas and desist letter to clueless mom pop then either a they re out of busi b they have to sell the right to use the mark to increasingli question sender or c they ve both creat and monopol a market for internet postag stamp that everybodi ha to pay them for the latter would be quit a coup if they could pull it off they do absolut noth use unless you consid threaten peopl with lawsuit use yet still collect a fee either directli or indirectli from everyon on the internet effect we ll be pay them for the privileg of polic their trademark for them i don t believ they ll ever get that far but i don t particularli want to help them make it and i use the term they loos becaus the whole compani could
