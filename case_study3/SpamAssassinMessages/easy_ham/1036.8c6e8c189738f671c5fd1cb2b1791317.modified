messag 5 through 22 is confus when ask to add remov messag from a sequenc if we are allow to assum 8 2 or higher which we can t realli then we could add if string is integ select sel bail out of

i ll hand it off to brent don t worri too much about it you seem to have plenti of other thing to do in the immedi futur and thi one isn t so critic that peopl can t use the code in normal way but to make it happen type with normal key bind ani digit so the code think you re tri a messag number then backspac so the digit goe away then other junk charact don t seem to have the problem i have just been play that will do it everi time that is 0 h onc you get into that state the same traceback occur for everi charact you type until a messag is select with the mous thi is look like it might be easi to find and fix so i ll take a look at it later brent welch softwar architect panasa inc pioneer the world s most scalabl and agil storag network www panasa com welch panasa com exmh worker mail
