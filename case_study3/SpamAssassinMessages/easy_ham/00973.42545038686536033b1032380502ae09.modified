can onli have a comment where tcl would expect to find a command switch ha a pattern bodi strucutr so if you goof and put a comment where it is tri to find a pattern both of you will be confus with the result the subtlti aris with extra whitespac and newlin i can t give you the exact case but i know exmh had one exampl that stop pars correctli and wa arguabl wrong befor 2nd i ve manag to remain fairli ignoranat of the pgp support in exmh so you ll have to dig in yourself or see if someon els on exmh user or exmh worker is have similar problem reg clemen said if you haven t alreadi you should enabl the debug log under hack support prefer and look for clue there reg clemen said hi on sun 01 sep 2002 00 05 03 mdt reg clemen wrote in messag with gnupg signatur but punch the line alway give signatur made thu aug 29 00 27 17 2002 mdt use dsa key i d bdd f997a can t check signatur public key not found so someth els is miss ye the public key of the signatur you want to check are you realli sure that you have the public key of the messag s signatur if not tri download it or tri to check a signatur fro m which you know you have the public key ah sorri for not make that clearer but no previous v1 0 6 of gnupg there would be a slight paus at thi poin t whi le it went out to get the public key from a keyserv now whether i have the key or not i get the failur messag it as if it cant find gpg to execut it but i fix that path so th ere must be someth els that i am miss reg clemen reg dwf com exmh user mail list exmh user redhat com http listman redhat com mailman listinfo exmh user

similar problem about a month ago elsewher in exmh which you found but first i realli feel like someth ha chang out from under me with my make no chang to exmh name when i first got gpg up and work for read signatur all i did wa touch the check signatur button and it went out and queri the keyserv for me now im get a separ box after the failur to find the public key on my keyr ask me of i want to queri keyserv i know that i never had to touch a queri keyserv button in the past but there it is now and i havent touch exmh spooki i have been work back and forth between gpg 1 0 6 and 1 0 7 but it not clear how that could be the problem as im now get the queri messag when run either ok enough about my confus the current problem seem to be a comment in a switch statement at line 86 in pgpwww tcl tcl 8 4b1 doesnt like it and i get your popup box remov it and no popupbox but exmh hang sigh so not a complet solut but at least a start thank for the interest reg clemen reg dwf com brent welch
