dimebox 1 right click on the folder label in the folder list that the way i have it configur and it sound as if the way toni doe too just doe a move rather than select as target without move of cours if you can manag to get no messag current select then it work fine 2 in the main window the key put you into a chang folder mode the first time you use it after start exmh hit a second and you go to set a target mode type a few charact of the folder name and hit space for autocomplet thi work but is not nice if you re not use the keyboard but just the mous toni i agre a nice way to link in one click would be good and should be easi to add though current ad mous bind someth like shift right click would be a good choic is much harder than ad key bind but note there s no need to undo the way i gener use link if the desir destin folder isn t the current select target is to right click on the target which select it and move the messag and becaus i have the automat move to the next messag on move or link option set select the messag again and then link exmh onli permit one uncomit action to be select for a messag at a time that is one of delet move or link select ani of those implicitli undo ani previou choic from the three so you can not achiev a move by do a link then delet then commit it need to be link commit delet commit xmh wa just the same there incident how s spring shape up down under no meaning comment from me i m not there at the minut but i m told that where i m from it is cold wet and miser though ha been better dure the day sunni day cold night for the past few in
