mostli italian thug think scorses s upcom gang of new york onli with counter reformatori overton hoover s south boston social club putsch start in the mid 1960 s wa particularli audaci in hindsight the u s feder govern actual decid to underwrit a revers of the prohibit era captur of the nation s racket by the italian from the irish the fact that the plot wa hatch not for new york but for south boston the most irish place in the us onli make even more gigant the big lie that wa told by the fbi to it ostens polit master about bring down organ crime there onc and for all the result as we all found out wasn t swap the heroin of italian boston mob violenc for irish methadon hoover wa posthum swap it for oxycontin or crystal methamphetamin or more properli pcp the absolut psychopatholog of

magnitud not mere percentag point as stalin said onc quantiti ha a qualiti all it s own and make no mistak j edgar hoover wa directli respons that qualiti of carnag nation wide so ye on paper at least it realli wa just the swap of one gang of racist thug for anoth and the result wa on paper at least busi as usual same stuff differ centuri with appar decent peopl like mr salvati et al accid ground

evil thi countri actual fought war to end increasingli coerciv axe handl beat by our own govern of the sacr liberti of the averag but now unavoid law break citizenri as ayn rand cynic observ a long time ago you don t need govern if nobodi s break the law in some twist corollari to parkinson s law govern to surviv need more peopl break more law or they can never justifi the money they confisc at tax time and to bring us back to the point david friedman would probabl echo here hi father milton s famou observ that govern regul onli benefit the regul seller in a given market and never the consum much less the economi as a whole even especi if those seller are break the law as they are in the increasingli ubiquit prohibit of riski behavior that our govern now impos on us and there absent the appar grace of mr hoover went mr salvati in fact hayek himself in the road to serfdom couldn t have predict ani better the gori consequ of hoover s blatant imposit for our own good of vietnam era statist power at the neighborhood level and furthermor stalin couldn t have had better use idiot than hoover did and neither by an absolut liter extens did whitey bulger after hoover use idiot on both

almost begin to fathom the atroc that wa commit by hoover and hi co religionist in state econom control in the name of what realli wa as you ll now agre just a race war between thug up in boston thi shouldn t be a surpris realli all race war are at least fought by thug though they re usual conceiv elsewher and endors at the time by all the right peopl for all the right reason as far as the fbi itself goe rememb mancur olson s observ that a princ is just a stationari bandit though given hi penchant for women s cloth for other men and what s actual obscen for violent hypocrit treatment of
