m messag id 1030544555 28815 tmda deepeddi vircio com so i ll probabl poke around at the sequenc perform issu well there s thi wonder piec of code in mhseqexpand hack to weed out sequenc number for messag that don t exist foreach m rseq if file exist mhprofil path folder m exmh debug mhprofil path folder m not found set ix lsearch seq m set seq lreplac seq ix ix els real hack at least i m up front about my hack break which is go to run slow if a sequenc happen to start with a bunch of messag that don t exist i m not sure whi it is import that the first messag in the sequenc return exist but not necessarili ani of the other but i m sure glad it is as mhseqexpand get call lot and i don t know if i could cope if it were check everi file in the sequenc it is look at all the time that wa my think my recollect about the first messag be valid is that the ftoc code want to find that messag to start it highlight for exampl or you are select a messag to display it may help to keep a list of the valid messag number for the current folder though that would then need to be verifi against chang to the directori doe tcl have a directori read function i assum so glob nocomplain mhprofil path folder will return an unsort list of the directori s content but the thought of keep an in memori list of valid messag is not fun exmh alreadi maintain in core list of messag in sequenc which is alreadi pretti tricki mh sequenc also goe and reread the file mh sequenc and the context file but i m not sure how frequent that one is call in some place i maintain cach of file by check their modifi time but the sequenc file are soo small that by the time you stat them to check their date stamp you could just read them again also now that we checkpoint messag state on everi messag view that file will chang everi time in the old day exmh use to cach a bunch of state about the folder brent welch softwar architect panasa inc pioneer the world s most scalabl and agil storag network www panasa com
