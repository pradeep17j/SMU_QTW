is that i ve spent much more time repackag the darn thing than actual test the function or tri to hear the great sound qualiti peopl seem to think it output but hey some of you will benefit from that right i ve got the whole thing work on a valhalla system but the packag should easili instal or at least recompil on enigma limbo null and mayb other who know here are quick instruct for those of you that wish to tri it out recompil the alsa driver sourc rpm for your run kernel you can instal the binari packag if you re use the i686 2 4 18 10 instal thi alsa driver packag instal the alsa lib packag instal the alsa util packag now go to thi url and find out what you need to chang in your etc modul conf file to replac the default oss driver load http www alsa project org alsa doc veri complet and veri good document hope you ll see that your card is support reboot or remov by hand your current sound modul you ll probabl need to stop mani applic to free the sound resourc by hand and insert the new one if all is well you ve got alsa work dmesg to check is a good idea you now just need to adjust the volum level with e g aumix and alsamix becaus everyth is mute by default with aplay you can alreadi test file to see if you hear anyth you can also instal the xmm plugin seem to make my xmm segfault on exit hmmm but mayb it s anoth plugin to listen to your good ol mp3 file that s it it realli isn t complic and ha never been from what i see the onli thing i dislik wa to have to instal from sourc but as i can t imagin myself do that i ve repackag everyth cleanli even the dev entri are includ in the rpm packag and not creat by an ugli post script i insist and seamlessli integr into the etc makedev d structur there are also a few other notic differ with the default provid alsa spec file for exampl i ve split alsa lib s develop file into an alsa lib devel packag and includ static librari there are other of cours oh ye the kernel version against which the alsa driver packag is compil get neatli integr in the rpm releas so doe the architectur i m open to ani comment or suggest about these packag download http ftp freshrpm net pub freshrpm test alsa current spec file http
