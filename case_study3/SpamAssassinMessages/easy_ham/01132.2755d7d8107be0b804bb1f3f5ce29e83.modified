sure it take a long time to do the rescan of sequenc i associ it with hit the flist button or when my background flist goe off i m run on a pretti fast system athlon 1700 512mb ram 10k rpm ultra scsi disk and hit flist use to take no more than a second the big differ might just be percept becaus the the old code just updat all the folder count color all at onc instead of make it look like there is 0 unseen then count it way back up i doubt i ll have much time in the immedi futur to hack at thi but if i do can you suggest area that might be the best to optim if not do you think we can put in some prefer to disabl some of the more intens featur i d rather disabl all the sequenc support except unseen of cours and have reason speed i suspect peopl on slow machin would find the current state unus if i knew where the problem wa i d fix it myself find it is probabl more work than the actual fix thi is becaus of your hook msgshow updat unseen which is call a fun ctio n which no longer exist i suspect you need seq del exmh folder unseen msgid now instead of mh markseen exmh folder msgid thank i m not sure i ll need it with the new sequenc code but i might doe your new code commit sequenc immedi the old code didn t so i put that in to help keep my mh and exmh window in sync ye it doe chri chri garrigu http www deepeddi com cwg vircio http www vircio com 716 congress suit 200 austin tx
