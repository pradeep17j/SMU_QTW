heart my opinion is onli that thi is one of the last frontier of commun instant show that we cross easili though you are right as rain on price i am mildli amus at the level of skeptic and innatent it is get my premis is that the world will chang in dramat and unexpect way onc there are a billion eye s which can instantli share what they see amongst each other that doesn t mean that peopl will stop talk on their phone or that peopl will spend more time w imag than voic just that it is fundament from news to crime to privaci to date to famili life to blooper and practic joke i believ there will be an explos of imag unleash specif by cell phone integr lens becaus of their utter ubiqu that dwarf all pictur taken in the histori of photographi by order of magnitud and in short order and ye chang

the user commun it anyth and everyth avg person could easili send half dozen pic to a dozen peopl a day mainli humor i d guess who care if content is trivial in natur pictur speak a thousand word thi doe noth to answer my question i do care about content hell if i could be convinc that peopl would send stupid pic back and forth all day i d have a differ opinion of thi i just am not convinc that they will stupid or not while a pictur may be worth a thousand word and thi is the same argument the guy who work for me made how mani peopl do you know who commun by pictur sure it sound nice to say that a pictur is such an effici messag mechan but how often do you actual find yourself draw someon a pictur to explain someth i don t buy it for most messag text work fine and is the most effici mechan for some messag pictur do the job but i would say not nearli as often as word whi do you think pictionari and charad and such are game becaus imag are usual not the most effici way to get a messag across misc rambl i suppos you skeptic forker would have said the same thing about 1 hour photo process trivial who need it i get better result elswher and yet it had great decentr impact the plant had to be downsiz and push to the retail oper the digit camera and final the integr digit camera phone bring thi cycl of decentr in photographi to a logic conclus which will put the photo giant to bed and chang the world in a meaning way also sm didn t take off becaus it easi it took off becaus it cost less it greatli iron the carrier often trumpet the profitabilti of their sm traffic over other becaus of it ratio of cost to bandwidth in realiti sm cannibil the voic rev s they bought their network to handl again thi is the same argument my colleagu made along with you just don t understand kid today and they ll run with thi i wasn t say that mm wouldn t take off becaus it wasn t high qualiti or that it wasn t easi i wa say that i couldn t see whi peopl would use it in a way that chang the face of commun i m look for the compel reason even if it s a stupid one whi peopl would want to do thi sure if they integr camera into the phone and the qualiti improv even onli margin i can certainli see peopl take pictur with their camera and occasion send them to other peopl but mostli i don t see what the benefit is to thi over send them to someon s email address or put togeth an onlin or offlin photoalbum i don t think 1 hour photo are trivial peopl want to see their own pic right away and the qualiti is plenti good enough for snapshot that s one of the main reason whi digit camera are catch on the instant view part i m guess your argument is that peopl not onli want instant view but also instant show which is what thi servic offer i m not convinc that most peopl want instant show i think peopl like to packag their pictur and show them that s whi peopl put togeth fanci album and sit there and forc you to go through them while they explain everi pictur sure occasion instant show is nice but it s just nice on occas i still can t see how it becom a integr messag method what s the specif benefit of take a pictur and immedi send it from one phone to anoth there ha to be some benefit even if it s silli if peopl are go to flock to it i m search no one ha given me a straight answer yet the onli realli intrigu idea i ve heard about thing like mm late are dan gillmor s assert that one day in the near futur some news event will happen and a bunch of peopl will snap pictur with their mobil phone from all differ angl and those photo tell the real stori of what happen befor the press even get there will to be proven wrong mike ps if the wireless carrier continu to price these servic as stupidli as they current are then mm is never go to catch on http
