cart a recent poll show that 74 of seattl resid would vote for the tax for peopl outsid of seattl who don t understand the consumpt of espresso the tax propos can be seen as crazi said john burbank the think tank s execut director but it wa common sens research by hi nonprofit econom opportun institut show that peopl prefer a tax on liquor or beer over one on espresso but becaus of the larg number of latt and cappuccino sold a tax on espresso could be lower than one levi on alcohol burbank estim the tax could gener 7 million to 10 million a year citi council aid disput hi figur say their research show the tax would bring in 1 5 million to 3 million a year burbank s institut is fund by foundat and labor union the think tank s mission is to promot public polici in the interest of low

espresso lover like chri altman who at a dime a day would spend an extra 36 50 a year said the invest is worth it i m ok with it said the 35 year old stir hi ice latt the money s got to come from somewher hope revuelto 25 wa cool her regular coffe 1 becaus she brought her own mug and read zen and the art of potteri she support the initi and said it critic are behav as would be expect of espresso drinker they want the most expens thing on the menu but resist pay 10 cent to help the needi some say the tax isn t the issu they just resent be singl out david marsh 45 a costum manag drink up to three espresso a day which mean he d be shell out an extra 109 50 a year i for one don t have kid but i drink espresso he said as he sew a leather collar onto a chain mail tunic i don t mind pay but i think everyon should pay coffeehous are steam about it and they ve organ as jolt join to oppos the latt tax among the member are seattl s chamber of commerc and the citi s two largest coffe franchis starbuck and tulli s the tax would forc coffeehous to track sale of ani beverag that contain espresso a task that could be an administr nightmar for smaller cafe especi dure the frantic morn rush if espresso count come under suspicion coffeehous owner could face a citi audit univers of chicago econom professor michael greenston said the tax doesn t add up the purpos of ani tax is to be effici and equit and thi is neither he said on the effici side it s sure go to lead to costli effort by both busi and consum to find way to avoid the tax for exampl starbuck could claim that they are use fine ground coffe instead of coffe run though an espresso maker and that consequ they are exempt from the tax would they be right i don t know but find out will sure take lot of legal fee that could have gone to child care of cours from a public relat perspect thi is an ingeni idea and i mean that in a cynic way they ve pit espresso drinker against child care support and who s go to side with the espresso drinker in fact the propos tax ha forc oppon into a polit two step where their critic must remain a beat behind their public stanc of polit correct in a liber citi like seattl corpor

pass on to consum through higher price effect punish them for their choic of coffe the tax would be appli to ani drink with at least half an ounc of espresso includ decaf drip coffe would be exempt burbank say the tax would reach onli a pre select group of consum who are wealthier than those who drink drip so he s been pitch it as a modern day robin hood tax where the needi get a dime everi time
