s composit in forb about five or six year ago the best way to get on the forb 400 is to have no colleg at all can you say bootstrap boy and girl i knew you could sure discuss in forb rigor research that especi when the data in their own list contradict them i continu to look at the list and all the inherit grow entri i guess if i read it enough time my vision will clear given that an undergradu liber art degre from a state school like say mine is noth but stuff they should have taught you in a govern run high school you ll probabl get more of those on the forb 400 as well as time goe on if we ever get around to have a good old fashion govern collaps transfer payment depress an econom version of thi summer s govern forest conflagr caus by the same kind of innumeraci that not clear cut enough forest did out west thi summer that should motiv more than a few erst slacker out there includ me to learn to actual feed themselv the next categori on the forb 400 list is someon with a termin profession degre like an mba phd md etc from the best school possibl whi becaus as of about 1950 the best way to get into harvard for instanc is to be smart not rich don t take my word for it ask their admiss offic look at the admiss stat over the year for proof i at on point look into stanford busi school after learn that tuition wa 20k no financi aid wa avail and part time work wa disallow thi smart person decid that i wa not will to spend the 150 applic fee non refund dure attend at my local busi school i wa told repeatedli i should have gone for it to quot a prof northwestern mba it ha noth to do with the educ you receiv in gener european and canadian busi school are better and more innov it the connect he use the word american nobil meritocraci american style wa invent at the ivi leagu after world war ii even stanford got the hint and of cours chicago taught them all how right practic nobodi who goe to a top 20 american institut of higher learn can actual afford to go there these day unless of cours their parent who couldn t afford to go there themselv got termin degre in the last 40 year or so and their kid still had to get the grade and bias by intellig test score to get in invent be the right word dubya went to yale and hb i guess practic get you around that problem the bizarr ironi is that almost all of those peopl with termin degre until they actual own someth and hire peopl or learn to make someth for a live all day on a profit and loss basi persist in the practic insan belief like life after death that econom is some kind of zero sum game that dumb peopl who don t work hard for it make all the money and if someon is smart work hard and is rich then they stole their wealth somehow btw none of you guy out there hold the short end of thi rhetor stick can blame me for the fact that i m use it to beat you sever all over your collect head and shoulder you were appar too dumb to grab the right end i went to missouri and i don t have a degre in anyth actual use much less a termin one which mean i m broker than anyon on thi list it s just that you of all peopl lot with educ far surpass my own should just plain know better the fact speak for themselv if you just open your eye and look there are no epicycl the univers doe not orbit the earth and econom is not a zero sum game the cost of anyth includ ignor and destitut is the forgon altern in thi case intellig and effort i will howev admit to be educ waay past my level of compet and by the way you discuss econom so have you appar it interest but in thi part of the world nova scotia a recent studi found that colleg graduat earn less than graduat of 2 year commun colleg trade school they did declin to mention that the demand for some trade is so great that some of them are demand univers degre to get in just for the record the averag salari for a univers graduat includ advanc degre holder here is c 21 000 14 000 us no wonder half of san francisco ha set up here we have a whole whack of call center that have arriv here in the last coupl of year i think they hire some entri level it peopl for around 10 6 us an hour which of cours fit perfectli for me my entri level job in 1986 paid 11 00 an hour the fundament differ is that most of the job that requir a trade are union in other word in thi part of the world for the vast major of peopl union due are a better invest than tuition the counter argument to thi is that mani colleg graduat leav for better work elsewher but the counter counter argument is that we are the thin edg one of sever realli prison labor in the us would be anoth of third world wage and work practic come to north america i work at a compani that had a 14 year wage freez the fact that they could maintain that and prosper just say volum about the economi in thi part of the world i met mani peopl there like me who felt that wa fine i can vote with my feet they didn t quit realiz that just about everi larg employ in the area ha similar or wors polici anyway eventu they start a union drive dure the vote retir employe were brought in by the employ rumour were that they were paid the go rate for a vote around here a bottl of rum and somehow allow to vote the union file a grievanc which wa deni by a minist of labour who hey guess what use to be a vp at the compani that s free labor market at work the busi continu to prosper as i wa told when i wa there it is a cash cow as long as the joa joint oper agreement with the compet paper is in place and if you think that ani of those wonder american compani out of some free enterpris belief in compet for the best talent are go to do anyth about that sorri most of them receiv gener subsidi in return i m sure for an understand about the labor market here btw if we ever actual had free market in thi countri includ the abolit of redistribut incom and death tax all those smart peopl in the forb 400 would have more money and there would be more self made peopl on that list in addit most of the peopl who inherit money on the list would have much less of it not even rel speak final practic all of that new money would have come from econom effici and not stolen from someon els invest bubbl or not that effici is call progress for those of you in the peopl s republ of berkeley or cambridg it mean more and better stuff cheaper over time a terribl petit bourgeoi concept appar not worthi of teach by the educ elit or you d know about it by now in econom term it s also call an increas in gener welfar and no virginia i m not talk about extort money from someon who work and give it to someon who doesn t in order to keep them from work and they can think of some politician as santa clau come elect time much as i like to accept what you say i do believ in free market i have difficulti find ani except of cours for labor market which govern go to great length to protect well unless the suppli is tight it wa a great run with the technolog industri produc most of the self made billionair on the list but now we ve got a govern sponsor monopoli and the concept of more stuff cheaper which it ha alway promis seem to be disappear a particularli gall exampl is high speed internet access an articl i read a coupl of year ago that it is an area where the price approach of the it industri cheaper better or you die and the telecom industri maintain your monopoli through regul and get guarante price increas through the same regul meet sadli to say the telecom industri seem to have won the whole entertain industri riaa palladium thing seem to be anoth instanc where actual give valu to the custom seem less import than use regul to reduc competit and substitut product in order to produc profit for the favor few in short then econom is not a zero sum game properti is not theft the rich don t get rich off the back of the poor and redistributionist labor theori of valu happi horseshit is just that horseshit happi or otherwis to believ otherwis is quit liter given the time marx wrote capit and the manifesto romant nonsens i usual agre but when there s a republican in offic i feel like they re the biggest believ in the manifesto in revers creat a reserv pool of labor reduc the right of that proletariat you ve just creat with bogu law and order polici concentr capit in the hand of a few ideal peopl who can get you reelect and the economi will take care of itself oh and lie use the word compassion a lot i guess i tend to believ that a certain amount of poverti reduct actual help a modern capitalist state the basic econom tenet of the republ parti seem to be the more homeless under each overpass the more effici the rest of us will be and the fact are for most peopl in the western world are declin standard of live declin benefit disappear social safeti net greater work hour essenti sinc the entranc of women into the work forc not blame women in ani way they have a right to work but it now 2 wage earner in each famili and still declin
