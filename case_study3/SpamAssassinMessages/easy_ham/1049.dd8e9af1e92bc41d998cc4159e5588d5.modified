well i ve use the check the modifi time cach trick for file in mani place not just exmh so some part of me certainli think it is effect howev it occur to me that if we do checkpoint state then aren t we modifi the sequenc file for the current folder on everi messag read perhap we look at the sequenc file more than onc per messag view as i d written the code a few month ago we were read the sequenc file first to see what sequenc were in it and then onc per sequenc thi happen anywher that we look at sequenc most notabl in ftoc showsequ that seem to be an obviou lose performancewis but i want my abstract to have a separ call for what sequenc are in thi folder and what messag are in thi sequenc one option would have been to add anoth call to get the data off of disk but i felt that the check the modifi time techniqu would be less error prone i like the check the modifi time techniqu i think the biggest gain would be from augment ftoc showsequ to allow a finer specif of what need to be updat in the ftoc so that the current code would onli be run when we realli do have to updat all sequenc for all messag i describ these thought in an email messag yesterday and again if it can wait a few week i m will to do it ok i ve yet to dive into the latest round of chang but i plan to i can say i ll make ani progress but i may dabbl thank again for all your work in thi area gener sequenc support ha been on my to do list for about 8 year brent welch softwar architect panasa inc pioneer the world s most scalabl and agil storag network www panasa com welch panasa com exmh worker mail
