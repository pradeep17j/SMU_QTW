well develop with highest bidder for while i think that the most import issu which is that end user won t be abl to fix their system is almost pass over i know that you know thi and you allud to it but your essay is get pass around so you might want to add to it bit about the sysadmin and other there s one other point which you don t make which i think is veri import which is that research into defin and address class of vulner can t happen without librari of avail vulner code i can think of three research into autom method for address vulner who gripe uninvit about the qualiti of the exist vulner site do research into a set requir that you have enough exampl in the open that you can defin a set and that the set is ad to from time to time so you can make and test predict i feel fairli confid in say that without full disclosur we wouldn t have stackguard its4 nissu or snort and the secur admin s job would be a lot harder adam on thu aug 22 2002 at 08 42 12am 0200 eugen leitl wrote

0400 edt from kragen sitak kragen pobox com to fork spamassassin taint org subject the underground softwar vulner marketplac and it hazard on august 7th an entiti known as idefens sent out an announc which is append to thi email briefli idefens which bill itself as a global secur intellig compani is offer cash for inform about secur vulner in comput softwar that are not publicli known especi if you promis not to tell anyon els if thi kind of secret traffic is allow to continu it will pose a veri seriou threat to our comput commun infrastructur at the moment the domin paradigm for comput secur research known as full disclosur peopl who discov secur vulner in softwar tell the vendor about them and a short while later after the vendor ha had a chanc to fix the problem they publish the inform includ code to exploit the vulner if possibl thi method ha proven far superior to the old paradigm establish by cert in the late 1980 which it propon might call respons disclosur never releas work exploit code and never releas ani inform on the vulner befor all vendor have releas a patch thi procedur often left hundr of thousand of comput vulner to known bug for month or year while the vendor work on featur and often even after the patch were releas peopl wouldn t appli them becaus they didn t know how seriou the problem wa the underground comput crimin commun would often discov and exploit these same hole for month or year while the respons disclosur process kept their victim who had no connect in the underground vulner the problem with thi is that vulner that are wide known are much less danger becaus their victim can take step to reduc their potenti impact includ disabl softwar turn off vulner featur filter traffic in transit and detect and respond to intrus they are therefor much less use to would be intrud also softwar compani usual see secur vulner in their softwar as pr problem and so prefer to delay public and the expens of fix the bug as long as possibl idefens is offer a new altern that appear far more danger than either of the two previou paradigm they want to be a buyer in a marketplac for secret softwar vulner inform reward discover of vulner with cash not long befor snosoft a group of secur research evid includ some crimin element appar made an offer to sell the secreci of some softwar vulner inform to the softwar vendor specif they appar made a privat offer to hewlett packard to keep a vulner in hp s tru64 unix secret if hp retain snosoft s consult servic hp consid thi extort and respond with legal threat and snosoft publish the inform if thi is allow to happen it will caus two problem which togeth add up to a catastroph first secret softwar vulner inform will be avail to the highest bidder and to nobodi els for reason explain later i think the highest bidder will gener be organ crime syndic although that will not be obviou to the seller second find softwar vulner and keep them secret will becom lucr for mani more talent peopl the result will be just as in the respons disclosur day that the good guy will remain vulner for month and year while the major of current vulner are kept secret i ve heard it argu that the highest bidder will gener be the vendor of the vulner softwar but i don t think that s plausibl if someon can steal 20 000 becaus a softwar bug let them the softwar vendor is never held liabl often in fact the peopl who administ the softwar aren t liabl either when credit card data are stolen from an e commerc site for exampl know about a vulner befor anyon els might save a web site administr some time and it might save the softwar vendor some neg pr but it can net the thief thousand of dollar i think the highest bidder will be those for whom earli vulner inform is most lucr the thiev who can use it to execut the largest heist without get caught inevit that mean organ crime syndic although the particular gang who are good at network theft may not yet exist there might be the occasion case where a market leader such as microsoft could make more money by give their competitor bad pr than a gang could make by theft think of a remot root hole in samba for exampl right now peopl who know how to find secur exploit are either motiv by person interest in the subject motiv by the public interest motiv by a desir for individu recognit or person know crimin that benefit from their exploit creat a marketplac in secret vulner inform would vastli increas the avail of that inform to the peopl who can afford to pay the most for it spi terrorist and organ crime let s not let
