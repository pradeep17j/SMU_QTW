to past someth procedur return the current select from ani window or cut buffer 0 proc text select if catch select get sel if catch select get select clipboard sel if catch cutbuff get 0 sel return return sel thi is in textselect tcl and is what exmh use to find text to past it is that last cutbuff get that is wacki becaus exmh stick it own delet into that littl know stash and is probabl the onli applic on the planet that still look there we should probabl just disabl that tri thi variant proc text select if catch select get sel if catch select get select clipboard sel return return sel everyth funnel through here so you just need to hack thi one spot rick baartman said i ve never understood the mous buffer oper with exmh either here s th e behaviour i have i have exmh and xemac window up and a termin window i also have gnome1 4 run and enlighten as wm i select text in the ex mh window and while it is highlight i can past into anyth els if i sel ect it and then click so the highlight is off then what i past is not the recent select text in exmh but an old select if i select in xemac and leav it highlight i can past it into exmh sedit window but if it is no longer highlight what i past is an old select i can live with thi behaviour except for one addit thing if noth is highlight then w hat i past into exmh is differ from what i past into other window to be m ore specif here s what get past if noth is highlight applic what get past xemac whatev wa last select unless it wa last select in exmh xterm same as xemac abiword noth nedit noth sedit whatev wa last highlight in sedit and overwritten the last need some amplif if i highlight someth in sedit then obvious that s what get past if the highlight is off then what get s past is not what wa last highlight in sedit but what wa last highligh ted and type over i have type kill sel on it seem that exmh and sedit are the oddbal here veri often when i tri to past someth in sedit i end up mutter wtf rick exmh
