hack to weed out sequenc number for messag that don t exist foreach m rseq if file exist mhprofil path folder m exmh debug mhprofil path folder m not found set ix lsearch seq m set seq lreplac seq ix ix els real hack break which is go to run slow if a sequenc happen to start with a bunch of messag that don t exist i m not sure whi it is import that the first messag in the sequenc return exist but not necessarili ani of the other but i m sure glad it is as mhseqexpand get call lot and i don t know if i could cope if it were check everi file in the sequenc it is look at all the time although my fingerprint are all over that it s not actual my code and ha been in there sinc befor 1998 it s code that i move from mh tcl to sequenc tcl and back again i m no5 sure either but it should be a one time penalti becaus the sequenc will be re written with the bad messag remov i think it may help to keep a list of the valid messag number for the current folder though that would then need to be verifi against chang to the directori doe tcl have a directori read function i assum so mh sequenc also goe and reread the file mh sequenc and the context file but i m not sure how frequent that one is call that wa a problem but if you look at mh sequenc and mh sequenc and mh sequenceupd they all call mhreadseq to do the actual read and it onli read the sequenc if the file ha been touch look for the exmh debug read filenam output in the debug log to see when sequenc are actual reread from disk my theori is that ftoc showsequ is be call too often i m about to investig that i ll email anyth i figur out sinc i m leav town in less than 48 hour have a good vacat thank chri chri garrigu http www deepeddi com cwg vircio http www vircio com 716 congress suit 200 austin tx 78701 1 512 374 0500
