by there s a compani hire in mountain view look for a few good hacker no java no gui not even c just c and linux and network and good old stuff like that they just rais a wad of money and they re look for a few realli good programm say the cto i know him veri smart guy drive too fast though for what that s worth joe bob say check it out i d be happi to pass on your resum or you can send it straight to them probabl won t matter if i pass it on sinc i don t know you guy anyway http www netli com sherri origin messag from joseph s barrera iii mailto joe barrera org sent tuesday august 27 2002 8 58 am to adam l beberg cc fork spamassassin taint org", "body": "subject re java is for kiddi adam l beberg wrote forward me stuff from a list is hardli hand me a job i wa talk about the open req at kana the compani i work for oh but program in java is beneath you nope just lack year and year of it for some silli reason peopl alway want thing to be reliabl fast and cross platform so all my employ have forc me to code in c c is more reliabl than java as for cross platform c exist on more platform but a java program is much easier to move from one platform to anoth so i m not sure what you mean i m not tri to fight a languag war but i m puzzl by the depth of your anti java hatr i know lot of high school kiddi with plenti of java tho not have to teach peopl about pointer or optim or anyth shave year off the coder boot time i ll send them your way when they graduat pointer so a languag ha to have pointer to be real and refer don t count i gather what s so great about pointer whi do you miss them if your do embed stuff fine ye you need the perform and control over memori that c provid probabl but if your implement tier n 1 of a tier n system and pound against a databas then java is often a veri reason choic especi if you want that system to run without leak memori optim who say you can t optim java i can and have and there are good tool that allow you to do it i use optimizeit but usual i find myself optim reduc databas access instead i sped one part of the system up by a factor of ten by group more oper into fewer transact but thi is besid the point if you have decent c experi and have poke around in java you should be abl to convinc most employ that you can be trust write java that s what i did i mean i join kana from microsoft and i didn t exactli write a lot of java code at microsoft i m not displeas you re tri to help just frustrat that employ can demand such redicul combin of skill with insan year of experi i don t think i ve ever interview at a place where i actual met all the prerequisit do you just give up when you don t interview tommorow with kodak do i have no idea what as the recruit isnt even sure but cross your finger it wont requir 10 year of java and 5 year of window ia 64 s devic driver experi both common requir i wish you best of luck and i apolog for be a bitch but god damn you piss me off sometim my son occasion display your can t do attitud and i do my damnest to get him to revers cours joe"}
