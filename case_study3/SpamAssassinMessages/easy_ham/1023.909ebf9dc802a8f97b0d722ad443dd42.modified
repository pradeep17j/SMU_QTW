support for it messag don t get me wrong i think thi is the case peopl will go to see your movi as much to be entertain and inform as they will to express their malic and discont toward not onli the present regim in america but also the corrupt empti shallow pantomim which cast them into power in realiti today the vote that take place via the act of consumpt far outweigh the impact caus by peopl go to a booth and dimpl the appropri chad or some other such convolut act of free democrat express whi becaus in america they believ in dollar dollar don t lie in practis they are the last frontier of truth in america univers accept as express of fear desir passion and need compar to the swing of the almighti buck and jeb bush know thi a hang chad ha onli the nethermost mean given that fact i modestli propos an entir new though wholli logic extens to the current democrat system in place in america i propos we augment and effect replac the elector system with a polit stock market we should accept that politician are entrepreneur just like ani other businessperson in america and embrac thi fact in build an econom system which truli reflect their intent a politician should issu a constant number of share depend upon hi tenur in govern those share should be trade on an open exchang say the g r e e d short of cours for the global realist elector exchang democrat politician we believ in will see their stock rise higher as faith in their abil to maintain offic grow as the truth about their embezzl campaign fund for weekend trip to maui with their intern is reveal of cours their fortun will fall thi repres an opportun for the market forc those same forc which you intend to har to express your own person protest to voic their opinion on the qualiti of america s govern dure the interven four year between elect elect themselv will in effect becom meaningless as they are now sinc their outcom will be influenc by the stock price of each and everi congressman senat and presidenti candid just think of the coverag that could be given on msnbc strom thurman strom news quot wa down 15 today on fear that hi latest heart oper will render him unabl to attend senat arm servic committe meet until novemb thi would provid rejuven content to the econo polit news sector which ha found post econom bubbl coverag to be both tiresom and deoress the establish of thi new stock exchang would of cours creat job for newli unemploy and government retrain it system engin who could after pass the elector secur exam becom floor trader thi would also allow for a conveni and veri public method by which candid could rais capit in the public market to support their multi billion dollar campaign the requir for the support of legion of spin doctor perman campaign manag and investor relat personnel would also creat job perhap even a new practic for ernst young arthur anderson et al insid trade scandal and mislead revenu declar would of cours catch martha stewart as an unwit beneficiari thu spread her influenc to polit dividend if there are ani on record at the close of a politician s career could be paid to current sharehold base on the hold pension fund could provid the institut invest support necessari to underpin even the biggest dog among the beltway set union fund brokerag and even pump and dump hous could benefit from meteor rise in conserv candid run in the southeast and the bush governmet would be allow to place social secur bet where they realli matter investor who lose their retir life save and support could rest assur that they were inde rob by crook rather than poor investor although there s no way to protect ani of these for worldcom like crash ambiti inspir district attorney could file crimin suit against candid and campaign manag who underperform expect thu assur investor that their logic wa not faulti instead they were mere defraud by crook and thiev on the whole i believ the system could work i could certainli work as well as
