event that befel our citi on sept 11 2001 all of those who perish must never be forgotten the footprint of the fallen twin tower and a portion of the 16 acr site must be dedic to a memori and civic amen that recal the sacrific that were made there and the anguish that those senseless act of terror creat for the victim famili and inde for all of us but for the good of the citi and the region the 10 million plu squar feet of commerci and retail space that wa destroy with the twin tower must be replac on the site about 50 000 peopl work in the world trade center those job are lost along with those of anoth 50 000 peopl who work in the vicin togeth those job in lower manhattan for which the trade center wa the econom stimulu produc annual gross wage of about 47 billion or 15 of the annual gross wage earn in the entir state some of the firm have reloc elsewher in the citi and region but mani have not new york citi is face a budget deficit without addit job the deficit may becom perman thi is one reason for the import of rebuild if we do not replac the lost space lower manhattan never will regain the vibranc it had as the world s financi center love them or hate them and there were lot of new yorker on both side of the issu the tower made a power statement to the world that said thi is new york a symbol of our free economi and of our way of life that is whi they were destroy thi is a second reason whi the tower must be replac and with build that make a potent architectur statement in recent week redevelop propos have been circul from mani sourc most of these focu not on the trade center site howev but on all of lower manhattan further mani believ that the 10 million squar feet either could be locat elsewher scatter in sever site or simpli never rebuilt these propos miss the point what wa destroy and what must be recov wa the trade center not all of lower manhattan except over the tower footprint where there must be no commerci develop the offic and retail space lost ha to be rebuilt on or close to where it wa access to mass transit make the site ideal for offic space of thi size that wa a major reason whi the twin tower were leas to 97 occup befor 9 11 none of the other site propos for offic develop ha remot equal transport access with the reconstruct of the subway and path station plu an addit 4 5 billion in transit improv plan such as the new fulton transit center and the direct train to the plane long island rail road connect the site becom even more the logic locu of offic develop and new york will need the space befor 9 11 the group of 35 a task forc of civic leader led by sen charl schumer and former treasuri secretari robert rubin conclud that the citi would need an addit 60 million squar feet of new offic space by 2020 to accommod the anticip addit of 300 000 new job the loss of the twin tower onli heighten the need as for those who say that 10 million squar feet of offic space downtown can not be absorb by the real estat market i would simpli point out that histori show them wrong new york now ha about 400 million squar feet of offic space all new construct underway alreadi is substanti leas up new york had 48 million squar feet of vacant offic space at the begin of the recess in 1990 by 1998 thi space had been absorb at an annual rate of about 6 million squar feet we are seek to rebuild 10 million squar feet on the trade center site over a period of about 10 year with the first build not come on line until 2008 and the project reach complet in 2012 thi is an annual absorpt rate of about a million feet much lower than the 1990 rate those who argu that new york can not reabsorb offic space that it previous had are say that the citi ha had it day and is enter an extend period of stagnat and declin i will not accept thi view nor will most new yorker mayor michael bloomberg said in a recent interview with the new york time that the citi ha to do two thing memori but also build for the futur i believ that the twin tower site can grace accommod and that downtown requir offic and retail space of architectur signific a dignifi memori that both wit and recal what happen and cultur amen that would benefit
