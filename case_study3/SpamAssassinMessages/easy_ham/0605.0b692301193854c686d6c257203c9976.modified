bad friendship when friend split up said dr keith e davi a professor of psycholog at the univers of south carolina it is often in case where one ha share person inform or secret that the other one want to be kept confidenti anoth form of betray dr yager said is when a friend suddenli turn cold without ever explain whi it s more than just pull away she said the silent treatment is actual malici at least as devast is an affair with the friend s romant partner as recent happen to one of dr lerner s patient i would not encourag her to hang in there and work thi one out dr lerner said a third type of bad friendship involv someon who insult the other person dr yager said one of the 180 peopl who respond to dr yager s most recent survey on friendship describ how when she wa 11 her best friend call her a derogatori name the woman now 32 wa so devast that she feel she ha been unabl to be fulli open with peopl ever sinc dr yager said emot abus may be less notic than verbal abus but it is more insidi dr yager said some peopl constantli set up their friend she explain they ll have a parti not invit the friend but make sure he or she find out risk taker betray and abus are the most extrem kind of bad friend dr yager said but they are not the onli one she identifi 21 differ varieti occupi the second tier of bad are the liar the person who is overli depend the friend who never listen the person who meddl too much in a friend s life the competitor and the loner who prefer not to spend time with friend most common is the promis breaker thi includ everyon from the person who say let s have a cup of coffe but someth alway come up at the last minut to someon who promis to be there for you when you need them but then isn t dr yager said some friendship go bad as some romant relationship do when one of the peopl gradual or suddenli find reason to dislik the other one with coupl it can take 18 to 24 month for someon to discov there s someth import they don t like about the other person said dr rose of florida intern one might find for exampl that in subtl way the other person is a racist in friendship which are less intens it may take even more time for one person to meet the other s dislik criteria whether a friendship is worth save dr lerner said depend on how larg the injuri is sometim the matur thing is to lighten up and let someth go she ad it s also an act of matur sometim to accept anoth person s limit accept should come easier among friend than among spous dr lerner said becaus peopl have more than one friend and do not need a full rang of emot support from each one but if the friendship ha deterior to the point where one friend truli dislik the other one or find that the friendship is caus undu stress the healthi respons is to pull away dr yager said to stop share the person or intim detail of life and start be too busi to get togeth ever it take two peopl to start and maintain a friendship but onli one to end it dr yager said friendship becaus it is voluntari and unregul is far easier to dissolv than marriag but it is also compar fragil expert say ideal the loss of a bad friendship should leav a person with more time and appreci for good one dr lerner said it is wise to pay attent to your friendship and have them in order while you re healthi and your life and work are go well she said becaus when a crisi hit when
