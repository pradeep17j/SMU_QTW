littl action but the depart of justic say it may be readi to file crimin lawsuit against individu 1 who distribut or receiv unauthor copyright materi over the internet deputi assist attorney gener john malcolm believ that crimin prosecut of copyright offend are now necessari to preserv the viabil of america s content industri malcolm also believ that peopl who trade copyright materi think they are particip in a legal activ i certainli think peopl who download copyright work understand that such distribut bar provis such as fair use is not author and it is not surpris to see busi continu to look for mean to discourag distribut of copyright work some prosecut that make that clear could be veri help i think they would think twice if they thought there wa a risk of crimin prosecut said riaa presid cari sherman who wa on the same confer panel i m not too confid that lawsuit would have the effect sherman is hope for although infrequ there have alreadi been civil suit or warn issu to privat individu and they have serv as minor deterr to the file share commun at larg crimin lawsuit carri with them the possibl of prison sentenc may gener further animos against group such as the riaa and may be difficult to initi becaus of the school effect of million of system particip in file share onli server would seem to stand out from the crowd the articl cite the no electron theft net act 2 which defin illeg activ and maximum penalti for copyright infring crimin infring ani person who infring a copyright will for purpos of commerci advantag or privat financi gain or by the reproduct or

other copyright work therefor receipt of a work of valu would be defin as financi gain even if no money is involv the net act excerpt doe not clarifi how the valu of a work is determin an album or movi could be worth onli 15 to million of dollar depend on whether the valu is assess from the perspect of the consum or copyright holder the statut of limit 507 limit on action a crimin proceed no crimin proceed shall be maintain under the provis of thi titl unless it is commenc within five year after the caus of action aros b civil action no civil action shall be maintain under the provis of thi titl unless it is commenc within three year after the claim accru the penalti are too extens to list here but they can be found in section 2319 crimin infring of a copyright in gener first time crimin offens will carri a maximum prison sentenc of 1 year i m still not sure where the doj would start in choos peopl to prosecut becaus of the aforement school effect but my guess would be that just like speed primarili the most promin individu who oper larg server or transfer the most data will be target in order to discourag more recreat file sharer thank to monalisaoverdr for point out
