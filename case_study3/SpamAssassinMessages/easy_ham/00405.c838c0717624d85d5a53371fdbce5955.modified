new way to give us fast mobil net access spell further troubl for 3g report peter roja peter roja thursday august 29 2002 the guardian imagin be abl to surf the net at speed faster than dsl from anywher at ani time you could watch a live video webcast while wait for the bu email photo to your friend while sit in the park or download the mp3 of the song that s play in the pub befor it finish thi is the vision of a high speed wireless internet paradis that the third gener 3g mobil phone compani have been promot for year 3g servic are just begin to be roll out but a new technolog call mesh network promis to deliv on thi vision sooner and more effect than the mobil phone compani could ever dream two compani us startup meshnetwork and moteran network of germani are each develop their own compet version of mesh network instead of the current hub and spoke model of wireless commun with everi devic connect to an overburden central antenna ani time mesh enabl devic mobil phone pda laptop are in close proxim to each other they automat creat a wireless mesh network everi devic in the area act as a repeat or router relay traffic for everyon els traffic hop from person to person until it reach the nearest internet access point reduc the need for central antenna and improv wireless coverag as the number of mobil phone soar and wireless pda laptop and other devic begin to crowd the spectrum thi approach to wireless network may be inevit mesh network also have sever other advantag over 3g wireless network while 3g oper roll out mobil servic that offer user connect speed of up to 144 kbp roughli three time faster than a dial up modem moteran and meshnetwork are abl to offer connect speed of up to 6mbp over a hundr time faster than dial up the technolog they use includ wi fi the emerg standard for high speed wireless network also known as 802 11b a similarli short rang protocol call ultrawideband which is pois to succeed wi fi is even faster and could by 2005 approach 400 mbp the rang of a typic wi fi network is gener too limit to be of much use when travel around a citi mesh network get around the problem of coverag by have everi devic in the network relay traffic even though the rang of ani individu devic is rel small becaus in theori there will be so mani user in the surround area connect will be faster and better than that of a standard 3g wireless connect becaus mesh network use wi fi the equip and infrastructur need to creat them is cheap and readili avail instead of build cellular phone tower that often cost hundr of thousand of pound all that is need to get a network go are wireless access point around 100 now place strateg around town to relay traffic and the proper softwar exist laptop and pda can be mesh enabl by softwar it also mean that anyon could set up their own mobil phone network unlik with 3g cellular the part of the spectrum that wi fi oper on is unregul in the us britain the mobil phone compani are none too pleas about thi especi sinc mani of them spent billion of pound acquir 3g licenc all that s need are cheap relay and mobil phone equip to connect to the network with everi addit custom that sign up coverag get better instead of get wors as is the case with mobil phone network but thing get veri interest when you realis that when you have high speed internet connect everywher and everyon s laptop pda and mobil phone are connect togeth at blazingli fast speed share music movi or whatev els becom ridicul easi when ultrawideband hit all of thi will just acceler at 400mbp copi a pirat copi of the lord of the ring from the person sit across from you at the cafe would take about 15 second sooner or later playground will be fill with kid swap file of their favourit song movi and video game but the first mesh network are not like to be avail to consum meshnetwork ha no plan to offer it own high speed wireless servic instead the compani plan to sell it technolog to other such as citi that want to provid wireless internet to polic fire and public work employe or busi that want to establish wireless network on the cheap moteran ha similar aspir for small busi and for enterpris network the first place averag user may use the technolog is when it is incorpor into vehicl enabl motorist to access the internet at high speed which both compani see happen soon when will you be abl to wander around town with a 6mbp connect in your pocket it s too soon to say but just as broadband internet servic wa initi avail onli to busi and univers eventu someon will see the profit in bring mesh network to the mass"}
