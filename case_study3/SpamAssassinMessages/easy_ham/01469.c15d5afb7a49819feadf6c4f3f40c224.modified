address in their databas that are undeliver for a few year do they still continu to spam them well here s my semi coher rant for the moment i have 3100 spamtrap on my machin you can multipli that by each domain if you realli want to the vast major all but say 10 have never ever exist yet spammer would semi continu connect tri to deliv mail to 40 of them disconnect connect again tri deliv to 40 more over and over they kept get user unknown until i got around to make them spamtrap so my evid would suggest that it depend who you re deal with if your busi is to sell address list to peopl who would then spam it s in your best interest to never clean your list therefor you can say 10 million email address and not technic be lie even if the major of them don t work if you re a spammer you d want to know who doesn t actual exist but then again you don t realli care you probabl want to relay through someon so it s harder to trace you if you could you d send to everi email address avail you don t want to setup a valid bounc address becaus again it s easi to trace you so i would say thi if you technic spam peopl but actual think you re run a legit servic you probabl realli do have a way of opt out even though the user didn t opt in and you probabl don t relay and you probabl pay attent to bounc everyon els doesn t realli care that s my view anyway 20 randomli gener taglin now you can do that thing with your hand it s ok prof farr 7zatkrhvyvssbbd2 content type applic pgp signatur content disposit inlin begin pgp signatur version gnupg v1 0 6 gnu linux comment for info see http www
