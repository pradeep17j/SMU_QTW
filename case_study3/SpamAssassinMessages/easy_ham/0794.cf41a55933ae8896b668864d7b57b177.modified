remain are melt out of glacier a bounti of a warm world by alex markel as he hike near colorado s continent divid in the summer of 2001 ed knapp notic a strang shape jut from a melt ice field at 13 000 feet it look like a bison skull the build contractor and amateur archaeologist recal i thought that s strang bison don t live thi high up knapp brought the skull to the denver museum of natur and scienc where scientist last month announc that it wa inde from a bisonon that die about 340 year ago thi wa an extraordinari discoveri say russ graham the museum s chief curat ad that it could alter notion of the mountain environ centuri ago there s probabl a lot more like it yet to be found and not just bison colorado isn t the onli place where glacier and snowfield are melt decad of unusu warmth in region from peru to alaskaa trend some think is link to emiss from car and industryhav shrunk or thaw mani of the world s 70 000 glacier as the ice reced a treasur trove of human and anim artifact is emerg extraordinarili well preserv after centuri in the deep freez the fabric wood bone and dna rich tissu found on the mucki fring of the ice are revis scientist understand of our predecessor health habit and technolog and the prey they pursu it s mind boggl how mani differ field are be advanc through studi these remain say johan reinhard a high altitud archaeologist and explor in resid at the nation geograph societi rare spectacular find like the frozen mummi he discov in the and of peru in the 1990 and the legendari 5 300 year old ice man found at the edg of a reced glacier in the alp in 1991 have offer time capsul of cultur and biolog inform now as the ice continu to retreat it is yield not just occasion treasur but long record of human and anim in the high mountain vanish act the trick is find such specimen befor mother natureand looterstak them first onc uncov frozen remain can deterior within hour or be gnaw by anim moreov they re often so well preserv when they emerg that peopl who come upon them don t even realiz they re ancient that wa the case when three men hunt sheep near a high glacier in british columbia canada three year ago saw what they thought wa a dead anim it look a littl like sealskin buri in the ice recal warren ward a teacher from nearbi nelson but when i look closer i could see leather fring from a coat and finger bone figur they had found the remain of anoth hunter or perhap a fur trapper the men stow a flint knife and other artifact in a zip loc bag and deliv them to local offici archaeologist later exhum the fallen hunter s bodi along with a woven hat fur cloth and what seem to be a medicin bag carbon date reveal that the hunter live about 550 year ago dub kwaday dan ts inchi or long ago person found by peopl of the champagn and aishihik first nation who may be hi direct descend he is perhap the best preserv human from the period ever found in north america other find from melt ice in the neighbor yukon region could explain what that long ago person wa do in the mountain in the first place befor thi there wa no archaeolog record of peopl live here say greg hare a yukon govern archaeologist now we see that thi area wa veri much part of peopl s season activ like ward s discoveri the search began by chanc when kristin benedek caught a whiff of what smell like a barnyard as she and her husband gerri kuzyk hunt sheep at 6 000 feet in the mountain of the south yukon they follow the scent to a melt patch of ice cover in carib dung it wa realli odd becaus i knew there hadn t been carib in the area for at least 100 year recal kuzyk then a wildlif biologist with the yukon govern carib cake return a week later he found what look like a pencil with string wrap around it it turn out to be a 4 300 year old atlatl or spear thrower further investig of the ice patchand score of other around the regionrev ici layer cake fill with carib remain and human detritu chronicl 7 800 year of chang hunt practic scientist now believ ancient carib and other anim flock to the ice each summer to cool down and escap swarm mosquito and fli hunter follow the game they return for centuri and discard some equip in the ice we ve got peopl hunt with throw dart up until 1 200 year ago say hare who now overse the research project then we see the first appear of the bow and arrow about 1 300 year ago and by 1 200 year ago there s no more throw dart now scientist are tri to make the search less a matter of luck they are develop sophist comput model that combin data on where glacier are melt fastest and where human and anim are known to have migrat to pinpoint the best place to search in alaska s wrangel and st elia mountain rangesth unit state most glaciat terrainand in the and johan reinhard think the fast thaw european alp could also deliv more find perhap as exquisit as the ice man global warm is provid us high altitud archaeologist with some fantast opportun right now we re probabl about the onli one happi about it"}
