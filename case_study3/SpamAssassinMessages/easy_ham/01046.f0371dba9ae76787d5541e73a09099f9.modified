accept patch comment suggest about all those spec file sure thing cool i ve ad to the spec some flag to remov oss and isa pnp support at build time if one wish to so is s possibl to do a rpmbuild recompil rpm without oss without isapnp ok i ll add thi also have the kernel compil by me i have no kernel sourc packag instal i ve ad a flag kernsrc that also can be use without to remov the depend for kernel sourc at build time it would be nice to check the correct kernel includ file actual exist lib modul unam r build includ linux h though howev i m a beginn in rpm build is it possibl to buildrequir for a file not provid by a packag at all i ve googl a bit and found no way to do that requir a file that isn t part of an rpm is not possibl no except mayb by stop the build process if it isn t found but that s errr ugli and i realli think that for peopl who instal a kernel from sourc the easiest is to instal the alsa kernel driver from sourc too i wa also consid ad some sort of flag for the with card option in alsa s configur but don t know how to do that onli found out about without from your first alsa driver spec and exist rpm doc don t help much thi would be a tricki one sinc to use the with name featur of rpmbuild i think you d need to add individu handl of each and everi card oh and one more thing at first i ve instal the first version of alsa driver for 2 4 18 10 although i don t have that kernel to suppli the depend for the rest of the alsa rpm s and compil the modul from sourc it creat the dev file and all that s what the alsa driver is there for creat all the base file exclud the kernel driver what i would suggest for depend reason it to instal an alsa kernel for the origin kernel you ve kept it right and instal alsa modul from sourc for custom kernel built from sourc then want to make my own rpm for 2 4 19 so now i m tri to rpmbuild the alsa kernel packag remov all alsa rpm and tri my spec rpmbuild ba alsa driver spec mine without oss without isapnp without kernsrc but i get thi long success compil snip rpm build error file list twice dev adsp file list twice dev amidi instal but unpackag file s found etc makedev d 00macro etc rc d init d alsasound oh and i think i ve forgot to mention i m run beta null inde the rpm 4 1 snapshot in null ha a few new featur among which have the build fail when file are present in the build root but not list in the file section i should remov them manual as part of the build process or mayb the new exclud path to file in the file section would do but i don t know how older version of rpm would handl it on my null build system i ve simpli set the variabl unpackag file termin build 0 matthia matthia saou world trade center edificio nort 4 planta system and network engin 08039 barcelona spain
