gamix one quick question is there a way to switch between digit out and analog out with the alsa driver and util or for that matter with gamix i know with the oss driver i wa use it wa as simpl as emu config d for digit and emu config a for analog with the emu tool packag for sblive i notic there is sb live analog digit output jack in alsamix but haven t figur out the key to use if thi is the right control in mixer also i tri to expand gamix to display all possibl control but it default back to wave and music with lfe center surround and playback under wave thi is how i control output of front and rear speaker for digit out surround and playback under music there are two control but unrespons i have a tuner and cassett deck hook up to an audio video switch that goe into line in on the soundcard again with the oss driver it wa as simpl as emu config d and emu config a digit out for anyth come from the comput analog out for the tuner and cassett deck i don t know if thi is necessari to switch inbetween to get line in to work or not but an expans of gamix would help where i could see all the control ani help would be greatli appreci and thank again for the gamix rpm kind regard
