environ notori for danger crime and poverti i have made startl discoveri involv young african american men and women who compris what i have come to defin as the black gener x i have becom awar that there is no formal distinct separ young african american from the gener definit of gener x asid from it be regard as the gener that follow babi boomer it s import to point out there is no root definit for thi term as well sinc the theme of thi work is center on identifi the realiti and misconcept of young african american cultur i have chosen a definit that incorpor all of the compon that were part of my birth childhood and young adult life taken from a web site entitl gener x creat and maintain by the colorado colleg the definit is as follow we are a group of peopl born between 1961 and 1981 we are individu who live for the here and now like to experi and who requir immedi result we are typic selfish and cynic and depend a lot on our parent we question author and feel like we carri the burden of the previou gener it s that simpl it seem we have come to be call xer s simpli becaus we repres someth neg to our elder we may be the one thing all of the gener that preced us have in common that is the abil to speak assuredli about our shortcom of cours they overlook the fact that we are their respons or actual their fault our gener will be call upon to look after our parent know they fail to look after us intergener justic fail somewher along the way and it will be our task to either rectifi it or make it wors we are a group of individu who grew up with no one at home after school it appear we have littl hope for the futur no job no home and basic no money are almost expect of us these bleak prospect along with the fact that we will be forc to support the largest amount of senior citizen ever do not provid much hope some believ that these blockad will be too much for us to handl and we will for the most part fail at life but mani see our individu and resourc that ha been built up through our childhood as our savior we will soon discov who is right and who is wrong thi definit is import becaus it demonstr the wide held belief that gener x is compris of one core group of american citizen it over gener the similar it express and appli them to all those who were born within the correspond year when in fact these similar speak primarili to onli white issu and concern for instanc they say we depend a lot on our parent but in ghetto america we could onli depend on one our mother they also say we feel like we carri the burden of previou gener and we will be forc to support the largest amount of senior citizen ever in ghetto america no one ever give these issu ani thought becaus surviv is in the here and now and is all we have time for i have known for mani year that the differ that separ gener xer s black and white occup would eventu be identifi i never knew i would be the one do it extract the black from gener x and categor it for it own sake is a necessari and import conting without do so the social ill that plagu ghetto america would be lost within the gener that are explain away as part of a collect american ident there are mani hidden truth that exist in black america today white america charg that we spend our time collect welfar refus to vote read elementari style book watch music video day dream of becom rapper basketbal player sell drug and make babi much of thi is support in marlon rigg s documentari entitl ethnic notion when african american are mention white typic envis an imag that is strikingli similar to the one that grace the cover of thi book a realiti that i confirm while watch roger me anoth documentari written and direct by michael moor sadli mani of us have begun to valid thi skew imag while other bend over backward in an attempt to pretend we do noth of the kind onli to be contradict and embarrass when present with the daili program line up for b e t black entertain televis mani of us fail to realiz that whatev embarrass or shame the ex pose truth may reveal should be taken as an opportun to improv empow enlighten and ultim chang anyon who is guilti of perpetr thi kind of behavior regard black women i have known mani in my life and although each ha had uniqu attitud and person i began to notic the major of them share the same collect mental toward black men as a whole that black men owe them someth and are requir to provid and fulfil what wa miss from their live be it emot physic or econom normal that type of assert would not warrant opposit from me so long as a reciproc attitud wa extend in most case it ha not been it s funni though look back i am surpris i never paid ani attent to the belief and attitud that differ black women subscrib to or the variou school of thought they possess mani have place strict demand and presumpt on the african american male some fair and some unfair much of what the public believ and understand about the black femal s social structur is often filter by other in the black commun who believ these inaccur and frequent posit represent will somehow chang the realiti that is what origin spark my attent wa an observ i stumbl upon while skim through and read book relat to black male and femal interact i notic virtual all of the book i read in the genr depict an inaccur and mislead concentr on the affluent african american perspect these stori and commentari tend to suggest that all african american thrive on a middl to upper class profession level they relay stori of relationship problem with huxtabl like bachelor and bachelorett whose onli concern is whi the other ha not confess hi or her love as i read these stori i couldn t help but becom irrit by the blatant omiss of the prevail major of blue collar or work class african american although there are those in the black commun that can identifi with the huxtabl like dynam unfortun they are few and far between the major of stori i have read seem to be gear toward fantas and romantic the oppress state of affair that have plagu black america the black author who have written these book fear the potenti backlash await anyon who would dare air out our dirti laundri the fact is truth should never be stifl by fear of ani kind i recent had a candid convers with some veri dear femal friend who state that although they fulli acknowledg the terribl state of affair mani of our women are current drown in they felt that public their predica would be view as a form of betray as our discuss intensifi i remind them that the onli way chang can be effect is by increas public awar that chang is need and oftentim not expos the truth can be more crippl than the truth itself the purpos of my book is in essenc an attempt to chang the self destruct think and self imprison behavior that black male and femal gener x have been subscrib to while discuss thi with my friend she suggest i simplifi my write style so my potenti black reader could better understand what i m attempt to convey acknowledg the real possibl of my messag be misunderstood i suggest to those reader that if they want to fulli appreci the finer point of thi narr to grab a dictionari don t feel bad there were sever time i had to as well regard black men an overwhelm number of us have becom preoccupi with be cool buy sport wear drive expens car wear gold or platinum jewelri and often without legitim person wealth and while live under the most deplor condit i have chosen to address thi rare acknowledg side of african american cultur becaus i have live it i have seen the chao and futil that exist on thi level it is a world of ignor selfish pre occup and idioci in my world there are peopl who applaud a lack of educ who brag about have serv time in u s penitentiari the type of gun they carri dope peddl and chase women they champion the notion of have children without ani regard to the poor environ mani of them current inhabit in thi world wear expens cloth and carri fanci handbag is mandatori even if it mean spend their last dollar in order to look like they ve got a million it s a world where children dress in over price sport wear mimick and idol whatev popular athlet or rapper is current in the public eye think such as the belief that fanci cloth are what defin one s self worth and the possibl corrupt thi think breed seem to not be an import concern for black mother it may come as a shock to know that most african american feel that those who don t have the same if not better materi possess are lesser be refer to them as be corni lame or broke even our male rapper entertain promot backward prioriti noth els matter as long as you look good the big tymer a popular rap duo have a song call i m still fli shown in heavi rotat on b e t and play regularli on black radio station throughout the countri fli is ghetto vernacular for well dress also use to describ a femal s beauti it signatur vers assert i got gator boot with a pimp out gucci suit can t pay my rent caus all my money s spent but that s o k caus i m still fli wors yet in the song grind the popular duo eclips glorifi the sell of illeg drug in inner citi neighborhood as children play and danc throughout the entir video the term grind is ghetto vernacular for the sell of illeg drug the fact that thi song and video is also shown in heavi rotat on b e t is further evid that our world is in utter turmoil some of the key lyric to thi song are grindingy know what i keep in the line the area in their coat where they hide illeg drug and patti cake patti cake i m the baker man i bake them cake as fast as i can and you can tell caus of how my bread stack up and i disguis it as rap so the fed backup in thi vers the group refer to the process of cook cocain and it transform into cocain base or crack when creat it is compress into the form of a larg cooki with the averag diamet be the size of a typic cake henc the term cake or sometim pie unfortun for the rap genr thi song seem to strengthen the long stand argument pose by most white that rap music is noth more than an entertain medium cater to violent drug offend who want and do noth more than carri gun and break the law the neg refer i ve identifi have becom an integr part of the urban african american exist thi mutat realiti is ridicul and unaccept thi ideolog should not be permit to continu ani longer than it alreadi ha there is an overwhelm part of the african american commun that is awar of thi crippl mental there are also mani that are unawar and unfortun more that do not even care those of us who are in the know have a respons to educ and enlighten those of us who are not awar of the neg behavior be perpetr daili whether becaus of habit or misguid valu thi type of ideolog is cyclic and thrive off of ignor it should be appar to us all that we can not wait for some other race to come and save us we must save ourselv i am well awar that mani of you are probabl furiou by now and are think what right do i have to express the opinion i have thu far as well as those i have al lude too i have chosen to chronicl my experi becaus of the divers and serious of their content there is far too much neg thrive within our cultur there must be acknowledg and account for the truth whether good or bad i am awar that not all of us have succumb to the crippl mental that is rampant in our commun and i have chosen to concentr on individu who have had a profound impact on my life ani similar and gener i illustr are direct sole toward individu in the black commun who share the collect neg think and behavior that will hereaft be identifi addit throughout thi book i will refer to african american in four differ way the first be african american denot our statu as citizen in the unit state secondli as black a refer that identifi and defin our differ and struggl in thi countri third as nigga a term which is often misunderstood and should not be confus with nigger the term nigga ha becom an accept form of refer among young black male use to express friendship henc the term my nigga as well as a blanket refer when speak to of or about other black male in a non person manner i felt it necessari to make thi distinct becaus mani of the experi i will refer to mandat the use of the term to effect commun the attitud and mood that exist dure the time each stori took place and fourth as ghetto thi term is larg intend as an intern refer commonli understood by black as a mean to defin the less polish member of our commun it is import to note that the use of either term ha no neg connot and is therefor not to be associ with ani feel as such my commentari is base on real life situat both good and bad and how one african american man wa affect by them to that end i feel it is necessari to acknowledg that my intent is not to condemn the individu i have encount despit the neg they have display i onli want to make them awar that the selfish and self debas attitud they subscrib to in mani way ha caus them to becom their own worst enemi in the case of the black femal s neg and limit perspect toward black men the world and subconsci themselv i submit that thi mental is perhap singl handedli respons for the lack of success happi and qualiti of life that is at the center of everi african american woman s fantasi quest it is also import to note that the selfish and neg attitud at the core of the tension that exist between black women and men ha been deliber creat by white america for exampl much of the exist resent between black women and men can be trace as far back as slaveri on up to present day mani past issu have taken on new ident and have re emerg in the form of corpor accept of black women and the corpor exclus of black men the result econom independ that some black women now enjoy ha caus them to challeng and judg the black man for hi absenc within corpor america without realiz and ackno wledg that thi absenc is by design there are other core issu that have been pass down and nurtur from gener to gener such as color barrier light skin versu dark skin good hair versu bad hair loyalti devot and econom statu believ it or not there wa onc a time when black women refus to date a black man if he didn t sell drug or wa not thug out a term for be rough or hoodlum like the reason behind it be that the thug and drug dealer lifestyl wa synonym with financi independ these issu among other relat directli to the confus mental that exist within our intern societi sadli that confus mental is respons for much of the neglect the african american ghetto commun receiv at the hand of our more affluent brethren who have lock it away in the basement and seem to be more concern with convinc the rest of the world that ghetto america doe not exist furthermor the lack of acknowledg of which i speak should not be confus with the impoverish mass of the african american commun their plight is a well known realiti but in mani case much of ghetto america fall under that same umbrella be advis thi book is not a color or lightheart look into black america rather it should be view as a legitim tool for identifi and chang the backward think that so mani young african american includ myself have come to perpetu moreov that backward think is the main caus of our inabl to strive for a common goal an outcom that must be met and can onli be met
